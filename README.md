# scheduling-model

## Overview

The University of Melbourne has bought a new supercomputer that will allow all their students and researchers to run complex simulations and programs to advance their research activities. Everyone wants to use it as it will accelerate the research process. To keep track and organize the supercomputer's access, the IT department has created an online form that requests the following information:
- Researcher ID.
- School.
- Desired start time for the activity (Hour:Minute:Second).
- Duration of the program (seconds).
- School evaluation for the activity [1 - 10].
The file Requests.csv contains all the different requests that the IT department has obtained for the first day. In this assessment, we will consider various scenarios, and you will assist them in selecting an adequate schedule.
